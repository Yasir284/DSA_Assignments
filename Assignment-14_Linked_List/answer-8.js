ðŸ’¡ **Question 8**

Given theÂ `head`Â of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum toÂ `0`Â until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.Â  You may return any such answer.

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations ofÂ `ListNode`Â objects.)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]
```
